<p>I can't tell how excited I am to go to <a href="http://www.livingartamerica.com/" target="_blank">Living Art America</a>. It has a very unique year for me and as part of this I wasn't able to 
attend many competitions this year. Also, I've missed the amazing World Bodypinging Festival in Austria this year. So I can't
wait to go to to the <a href="http://www.livingartamerica.com/" target="_blank">North America Official Championship</a> and meet lots of old friends and create new ones!
</p>

<p>Well, yes... of course, I can't wait to get my hands dirty and paint! :)</p>
