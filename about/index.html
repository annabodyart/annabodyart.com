<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I love colors and art.. it's funny but I had completely different studies at school: numbers, rules and all about economy.</p>

<p>
	When I was a child I was drawing every day and for 1 year took drawing lessons after school. But my life brought me to a different direction and I started dance school too... slowly I stopped to draw and started to dance professionally. I simply forgot my passion for colors. I grew up dancing.
</p>

<p>
	After, I’ve got married and had 2 kids. This slowly stopped my career as a dancer. At that moment I started to look inside me to search myself and what was my passion..what I wanna be. At the same time I needed a job, so on January 2014 I decided to buy a simple 10 colors kit and try to learn how to paint kids at parties. I loved it!
	Colors, brushes and sponge reminded me how much I love Colors and Drawing. I started to study by myself, read articles on-line and watch YouTube tutorials. My capacity as a face painter fastly improved. After 1 year, in January 2015 I did my first face paint competition in Verona-italy where I placed 5th.
	In that occasion I saw for the first time a body painting competition. I was completely amused by all these colors, projects and the stories behind the body paintings. I decided to try and in March 2015 I did my first body painting competition. After this I didn't stop and I started to do all competitions possible, to try, learn and have fun. In July 2015 I decided to measure myself (at that time, this was my 3rd body painting ever) and participated to the World Body Painting competition in Austria where I placed 20th on a total of 50 participants. This push me to believe that maybe I could really do it.
</p>

<p>After that I did more competitions and in November 2015 I won the BTC 8 competition in San Antonio Texas.</p>

<p>From that moment I started new projects and ideas… more colors and BodyArt on the way!!</p>
