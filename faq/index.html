    	<h4>How long does color it last?</h4>

    	
    	<b>Glitter tattoos</b>: 4/5 days.
    	<b>Airbrush tattoos</b>: around 7/10 days
    	<b>Regular Facepainting/Bodypaint</b>: I use water based colors so they can be removed 
    	with water and soap (or simple baby wipes). There are a few color (like
    	some blue or green tones) that have a stronger pigment so to remove them
    	the operation need to repeated more times to get them entirely off. Usually
    	baby oils can help.


    	<b>NOTE:</b> All the information above may vary drastically depending the skin exposure
    	to sun, showers, swimming pool water or other chemicals, etc..

    	and are for kids and adults.

  		problems.

  		brushes and colors. For more details see the question below.

    	<p>
    	Oh, Yes! All my brushes are always cleaned and sanitized with specific products
